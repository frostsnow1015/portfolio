Just discovered this React UI Framework and turns out it's so convenient to implement it on these projects.\n\nWhen developing COVID-19 Data app, I realized Evergreen UI have no opinionated way to construct responsive layouts. So, I decided to combine it with TailwindCSS which I already tried to use at this personal site. It worked.\n\n![Evergreen UI (1)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_1.jpg)\n![Evergreen UI (2)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_2.jpg)\n![Evergreen UI (3)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_3.jpg)\n![Evergreen UI (4)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_4.jpg)\n\nI decided to deploy it using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and I'm so shocked by how fast it is compared to [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I'm considering to migrate to Vercel from Netlify for my previous projects, including this site.\n\nI posted my recent projects [here](https://sznm.dev/projects).\nYou can access the project and the project's GitHub repository link from this [page](https://sznm.dev/projects).\n",
